# âš¡ ML+Renewable Energy Research Project

2 seperate models are used in this process, one for wind installations and one for solar instllations. 



My project uses machine learning techniques to predict a location's suitability for a utility-scale wind or solar energy installation. Specifically, my project identifies locations with promising resource potential. The data I used is from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Physical Solar Model API. My project is also available for users on the Python Package Index.

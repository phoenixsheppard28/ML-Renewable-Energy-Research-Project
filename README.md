# Renewable-Research-Project

2 seperate models are used in this process, one for wind installations and one for solar instllations. 



In the other repository on my profile (Renewable_Suitability_Predictor) you will find the files and documentation of a python package that employs the machine learning techniques used in this research project for consumer and industry use
